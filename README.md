General Info

	This project's is about experimenting with octrees and octree-based ray-casting.
	
	It is currently focused around a compressed, yet dynamic octree-implementation, which can be found
	in och_h_octree.h.
	This is inspired by "High Resolution Sparse Voxel DAGs" by Viktor KÃ¤mpe, Erik Sintorn and Ulf 
	Assarson (ACM Transactions on Graphics 34(4), 2013). However, unlike the structure presented in
	the paper, h_octree can be dynamically edited at runtime, while achieving "ideal" compression for
	a given topology, regardless of the order of operations performed. This is achieved by using a 
	reference-stable, reference-counted linear hashtable to store tree-nodes, hence avoiding the need
	for separately storing identical nodes.
	
	The ray-traversal algorithm is an adapted version of the one presented by Samuli Laine and Tero 
	Karras in the appendix of Efficient Sparse Voxel Octrees: Analysis, Extensions, and Implementation
	(Nvidia Research, 2010).
	I recommend having a look at the original paper to gain an understanding of the algorithm, as this
	one is a bit lacking when it comes to comments.
	The major adaptations are the use of a bitmask indicating the dimension of the currently traversed
	node, as well as an early branch which avoids an overstep-correction when traversing up the tree.

Getting it Running

	The easiest way of executing the code on your own machine is using Visual Studio and its Git/Github
	integration. If you aren't familiar with this extension I recommend Bill Raymond's Video "Up and 
	Running with GitHub and Visual Studio 2019" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csgO95sbSfA).
	From there it should be a simple matter of compiling the solution and... voila.

Keybinds

	Camera movement:

	W, A, S, D		Move camera
	C			Switch camera-mode between horizontal and directional movement
	Shift			When the camera is in horizontal move-mode, move down
	Space			When the camera is in horizontal move-mode, move up
	Mousewheel		Change camera-speed. If Shift is pressed as well, change slower

	Interaction with tree:

	LMB			Remove a voxel
	RMB			Place a new voxel
	T			Place 40^3 voxels
	Z			Remove 40^3 voxels

	Various:

	ENTER/ESC		Close window
	I			If the camera is in an active voxel, move it to the first empty voxel above it
	O			Toggle debug-output in top right of screen
	M			Mark a point to measure a distance

	These are only available when the Visualisation-window is open and in focus.

Customization

	Voxel-names and their colours can be specified in the file "voxels.txt". In the future, tree-filling will be directly adjustable as well 

Roadmap

	Implement terrain-customization

	Make tree center on camera (fh_tree)

	Port tracing to GPU (CUDA)
